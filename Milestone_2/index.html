    <h1>Education Summary</h1>

    <p>
      I graduated highschool at York Early College Academy and in 2023 I began
      attending St. John's University. I decided to pursue a degree
      in Computer Science because of how much I wanted to learn more about
      computers and how they operated ever since I was young. Unfortunately,
      I don't have any degrees yet but as this is my Senior year I will be graduating
      with a B.S in Computer Science soon!

    <p>
      When I have a break I enjoy playing video games with friends or reading. Recently, I have been
      playing a fair amount of Minecraft on a server with my friends. My personal favorite games include: Risk of Rain
      2, Terraria and Hades.

    <h1>Favorite Song, Movie, and TV Show</h1>

    <p>My Favorite Song:</p>
    <p>Cafuné - Tek It</p>
    <iframe width="750" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7RWbq-lbBlk?list=RD7RWbq-lbBlk"

      referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>I dont have a particular reason for why I enjoy this song. It just sticks out to me and I always come back to it.</p>

    <p>My Favorite Movie:</p>
    <p>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</p>
    <iframe width="750" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g4Hbz2jLxvQ"
      title="SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE - Official Trailer (HD)" frameborder="0"
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
      referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This movie is amazing from beginning to end. If you haven't watched it already please do, ASAP. I always loved 
  Spider-Man so I may be a little biased but it doesn't change the fact that this movie has shown how far animation could go.
</p>

    <p>My Favorite TV Show:</p>
    <p>Arcane</p>
    <iframe width="750" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fXmAurh012s"
      title="Arcane | Official Trailer | Netflix" frameborder="0"
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
      referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>While I'm not a big fan of League of Legends (The game that the story of Arcane is based off of),
        the show itself has great story telling and really conveys emotion between the characters. I did enjoy Season 1 a bit more than
        season 2 but it still had a great story and finished off the series well.

         <span>This website saved me from boredom alot of times when I was younger whether it was during school or at
          home. Although I have 
          outgrown it and it hasn't been as good since Flash got discontinued, it will always have a spot in my top 5
          websites of all time.
